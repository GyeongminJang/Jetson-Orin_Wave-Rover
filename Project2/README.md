# Project2: Intelligent Vehicle Handling and Avoidance

This project implements intelligent vehicle detection, stopping, overtaking (avoidance), and lane recovery for autonomous driving scenarios using Python.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

- **Vehicle Detection & Stopping:**  
  Detects vehicles ahead using height information and stops the rover if a vehicle is detected within a certain threshold.

- **Automatic Overtaking (Avoidance):**  
  If the detected vehicle does not move within 5 seconds, the system initiates an overtaking maneuver:
  1. **Avoid Mode:** Steers to avoid the stopped vehicle.
  2. **Return Mode:** Aligns parallel to the road after avoidance.
  3. **Recovery Mode:** Fine-tunes position to return to the lane center.

- **Cut-in Handling:**  
  Detects when another vehicle cuts in and follows or stops as needed, then overtakes if necessary.

- **Robust Logic:**  
  Ensures that after one avoidance, the same vehicle is not avoided again, preventing repeated maneuvers.
